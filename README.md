# Fernley Virtual Queue
## Brief
Researchers at Cambridge University have suggested to the Government 275 non-pharmaceutical interventions to help ease the lockdown that we are all living under at the moment. Some of these interventions include ensuring background music is not played in shops so that customers don’t have to get close to staff in order to hear clearly and virtual lessons.

The intervention that you need to provide a solution for is that of virtual queuing.  The idea is that, instead of dozens of customers arriving at a store at the same time and having to queue and shop in close proximity, there is a virtual queue that customers can book a place in and then arrive at the store for their allocated time - thus eliminating the need for quite as much personal distancing and time wasting as would otherwise be the case.
